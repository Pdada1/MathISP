Calculus Jeopardy

This is our MCV4U0 Calculus and Vectors final culminating project!

Note that the program requires a Java Runtime Environment, which can be downloaded online at https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/. Alternatively, we can provide a version of the game with this Java environment included - it just has a large file size, so we did not include it by default.

The software app is made up of randomly-generated questions and numbers, meaning it is infinitely replayable. It covers every unit that we covered in the course, including Differentiation, Applications of Differentiation, Integration, Applications of Integration, Differential Equations, and Vectors/Planes in R3. The software is fully optimized, with efficient code and reasonable functions/answers of varying difficulty (unfortunately exact values cannot be entered, it must be a decimal number due to software limitations).

Moreover, the graphical interface is pleasant to the eyes and has sound effects that make the experience more engaging.
